//this is a java source file
public class hello_java { //a symbol of class start,and in one source file always allow one public class

    //a symbol of main func in class,and this is a mostly certain code string
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        //print the strings to the console
        System.out.println("wo ai java !!");
        System.out.println("hello, world!");
    }

//a symbol of class start
}


//when you finish the code above, then you may should print "javac hello_java" to get the java class file,which is a "二进制字节码文件"
//then print "java hello_java" to get the result like below strings:

//wo ai java !!
//hello, world!


//**(if the class file didnt be came up with, you may change the GBk code
